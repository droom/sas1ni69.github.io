      My name is Hassanin Ahmed, sas1ni69 on the interwebs and I'm a Ruby on Rails developer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
    </p>

    I enjoy stand up comedy, singing, playing the guitar and Ultimate Frisbee. I strive to learn and to reinvent myself, over and over again. I've been developing for the web for the past 4 years and I've loved every day of it. I've had servers crash on me, databases wiped, code broke, clients threatening murder and about a thousand other software development crisis.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've also co-founded <a href="http://cagedindustriesonline.com">Caged Industries</a> a health and fitness portal that is active in Malaysia. I've also consulted 2 different startups at different stages of their development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I began teaching myself programming when I was 14, starting with C++. Naive and with no guidance, I began writing little RPG games on the console that I never played. I moved on to Visual Basic 6, ASP.NET 2.0, Python, Javascript, PHP and eventually Ruby.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am nothing without the people who taught me and gave me advice along the way, both offline and online, directly and indirectly. I try to write this blog as a reference to both myself and anyone who needs it. I also list my past and current <a href="/portfolio">projects</a> on this site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Say hi to me anytime, I would love to hear from fellow developers and tinkerers. I hope to give back as much as I've received and still receiving.
