A few years ago, I set a list of new year's resolutions which I often don't stick to. I don't remember the full length of the list but one of them stands out clearer in my memory today.

"Learn to say no."

I identified this flaw in me a few years ago and it just hit me today that not only did I not learn to say no, I've gotten worse at it.p

I admit, I, to a certain degree, am a people pleaser. More than that, I just hate to reject somebody's request. Recently it has hit me more than ever that this is not only causing me harm, it's causing the people around me just as much, if not more.

I am making a concious effort to say no. I thought I should put it in writing. The last time I did write about something that I desperately wanted to learn turned out really well. (Learning Vim, it took me the entire year though, but I got there in the end.)

Now, damage control.
