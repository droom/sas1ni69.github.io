Over the past 3 weeks, I've been practicing TDD in Rails almost exclusively. It has been one of the most challenging and rewarding part of development.

Although, I've known of the conceptual benefits of TDD for a long time, I've only written automated tests in places I've deemed absolutely necessary.

What TDD has given me is also another debugging tool and a layer of absolute confidence in my code.

Debugging with TDD especially has sped up my development speed which is making up for the drop in productivity by writing all the extra tests.

One of the nicest points of references that I've been keeping up with is <a href="http://betterspecs.org/">Better Specs</a>. I also highly recommend Aaron Summer's <a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails - Testing with Rspec</a>.
