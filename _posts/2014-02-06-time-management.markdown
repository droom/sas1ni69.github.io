"I just don't have the time." This is what I've been telling myself for the past few months, but why? Poor time management, that's why.

Within the past few months, I've found myself knee deep in a lot of projects which I have overcommited to and I am struggling, truly struggling to keep up with every single one of them. No amount of project managmenet tools or calendars is helping either.

I've recently found myself heavily involved in almost 5 projects and with at least one foot in 3 others, not including any of my own projects. I've brought myself to drop some projects that I have been working on which amounted to some good money completely out of guilt. The guilt of under-delivering. I don't want to sign off my name on a project that was half assed just because I got myself here.

I also know that under no circumstance I can keep up this work rate for much longer. Unfortunately for me, my work production has also dropped along with my efficiency and concentration.

I have been keeping track of all these projects on <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and scheduling all my appointments on my ever accomodating Google calendar. Having too many projects have also translated into a butt-load of unnecessary meetings and discussions.

Where do I go from here?

Besides dropping a few projects, I'm also going to tie up some loose ends on some other projects.

A few days ago, we had a pretty good launch for <a href="http://cagedindustriesonline.com">Caged Industries.</a> The design came up to be much better than it was a few months ago. Everybody is pretty happy with the overall success of the project dispite some minor disputes with the hosting provider. I've since migrated the hosting to <a href="http://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean.</a>

I must also learn to say 'no.' This talent eludes me.
