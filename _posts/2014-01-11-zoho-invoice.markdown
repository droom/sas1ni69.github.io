Up until yesterday, I was writing proposals and invoices in .docx templates I got off the internet some time ago. I haven't picked up too many freelance projects at one time so this was never an issue.

Since I've been invovlved in a bit more projects now, I decided that it was time I looked for an application that would help me track and generate the invoices/proposals on the fly.

Google's first result pointed me to <a href="https://invoice.zoho.com">Zoho Invoice</a> and I kindly obliged since I was already a member of the site.

So far so good, I was up and runing really quickly and I quickly passed my first 3 invoices fairly quickly. I was able to make changes to the invoices almost immediately.

The settings were pretty neat too, I didn't have to look around too much for what I wanted to add to the template. 

I have yet to see every option that I can set.

On the front page, there's a panel that displays how much cash inflow you have from open/unclaimed invoices but it doesn't work so well with multiple currency. It shows the total regardless. I'm not sure if that's a bug or feature. Perhaps it's something that I've missed.

Overall I like Zoho's one size fits all approach but I might be looking for something more specific to project proposals AND invoices.
