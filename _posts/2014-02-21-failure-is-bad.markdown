I often hear statements like "failing is good" and "you should fail often" over and over again. No, failure is bad.

Though I understand the motivation and how failure itself can be a fantastic opportunity to learn what not to do and an excellent time to discover areas of improvements.  At the same time, this is encouraging the sort of thinking that if a person fails, everything is going to be okay. Nobody is going to get hurt and no one will be affected in any sort of way.

Keeping a safety net your mind consistently allows you to slack and could potentially allow you to give up faster than you should. Questions like "maybe this has already failed?" often creep into my mind. I start assessing my projects from a failure's perspective first, which is very negative.

Sure, failure is not final but I honestly believe over "celebrating" and over "embracing" failure can lead to more mediocre attempts at projects that have so much potential to offer.

A good product developer would recognize that there are more than one single door he can knock on.

I understand that failure is good, but I want to succeed more than anything in the world. Failure is hard, success is exponentially harder.

How success is judged though, is absolutely subjective.
