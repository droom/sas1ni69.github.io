Ever since I touched a computer, I've loved the keyboard. The greatest input device ever created. I learned about Vim a few years ago through a forum. It was titled the great Vim vs Emacs debate. I was intrigued.

I didn't know how to install it, nor did I know how to get started with it. I forgot about it. Few years later, I was finally faced with a challenge I didn't know how to solve, how do I edit a file on a remote server. All I had was this terminal window in front of me. I asked another developer and he said just use Vim. 

I quickly knew what it was but I had no idea where to start and what command to launch it. He quickly showed me around the terminal and I was more mezmerized than ever!

I went back home and I installed Vim and launched it. It was a lot less appealing than the one I just saw. I Googled around endlessly and learned a little about the vast sea that was Vim customization. From plugins, to Vimscript, to themes and what have you. Truth be told, I was overwhelmed. Here I was, trying to use a text editor that I keep reading about. All anyone said was that it is legendary. But I just couldn't use it. It seemed like the most anti productive thing that I have ever seen.

I was really put off by it but in the back of my mind it has always been a goal.

A few years ago, I stumbled upon Sublime Text after some lengthy spells with Netbeans (for Java and.. PHP development). It was a whole other world. The first time that I learned about it's multicursor feature, I was sold. I would say that I am super efficient with Sublime Text, my optimum efficiency. The keyboard shortcuts are second nature.

But.. Vim has always been on the back of my mind. I even tried challenges where I'd force myself to use it for a certain length of time, the last time was last December where I tried to go 30 days without Sublime. At that point I wasn't really comfortable with Vim but I wasn't a stranger either. It didn't last a week though, I honestly can't say it even lasted 2 days. Another failure.

Fast forward 9 months and junior developer and I were pair programming and he fires up Vim! Finally, my opportunity, to ask all the questions that I've been wanting to ask. 

I reinstall Vim and he helps me with some settings. Minimal changes, no .vimrc file that is alien to me. I write down a list of features that I would like to have from Sublime Text and I start to really use it. For the first time it feels comfortable, like I've always known it would be, like I've always wanted it to be.

I sit here writting this with Vim, efficient enough to not stumble every 3 seconds. I haven't reached for the trackpad as much as I thought I would.

I still have a list of questions but I'm happy with my current configuration. I even got the clipboard to yank into the system clipboard. Huge achievement for me!

I will once again, issue the 30 days of Vim challenge for myself and I will report back.
