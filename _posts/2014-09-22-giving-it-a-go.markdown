I'm lactose intollerant, so I keep my cheese to blog post titles.

I've been hovering about the Go lang atmosphere for quiet a bit now but never really gave it a good enough attempt.

So a few weeks ago, I decided to use Go to write a small CLI tool that allows me to call on Google's URL shortener. It was a problem that I face quiet a lot (I share a lot of memes on IM)

Go is easy to pick up if you know another low level language. Importing libraries from Github is also super straight forward. It is very obvious that it's a modern language built with modern developers in mind.

There are a few web frameworks that are rapidly increasing in popularity but I've yet to give any a real crack.

I would also like to work on a project that is bigger than this little experiment but it's a good start in my opinion. I've been using my tool a lot more often that I anticipated.

Here's a link to the [project](https://github.com/sas1ni69/urlshortener)
