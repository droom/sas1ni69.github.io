From a career perspective I was pretty contented with 2013 and I'm really excited to start 2014. It has started well enough.

I've been engaged by a studio based in Barcelona, Spain to work and collaborate remotely on a fantastic application they're building. It's a very well thought out application but I can't share more details at this time due to the nature of the agreement. I will write something about it when the time is right and they're ready to launch.

The current engagement is only short-period but it's going to be an excellent experience working remotely with another team that works in a different time zone.

From our initial discussions, the bulk of the work will be on the front-end of the application and is going to be written in Angular JS.

I've been very interested in Angular JS for some time now but I have yet to deploy anything into production with it. Hopefully this is the chance I need.

I'm very much looking forward to the opportunity to collaborate and possibly be mentored by the founders/developers at the studio who are working on a variety of exciting projects.

Through this experience I'll hopefully be able to write more about working remotely and Angular JS.

Wish me luck! Happy new year.
